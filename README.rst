Features

SmartConfig Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By pressing the button for a long time the device will enter a configuration mode.
Using `smartconfig <https://sming.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_inc/samples/Basic_SmartConfig/index.html>`_ one can easier provide 
WIFI credentials without having to flash new firmware. 

Automatic Over-The-Air(OTA) updates

The application will be updated automatically when there is a new version. 
This is done via a secure connection to a MQTT server. 
If interested you can easily change the MQTT server with your own one.

Internet gateways, Wi-Fi access points and mobile devices to seamlessly discover each otherâ€™s presence on the network and establish 
functional network services for data sharing, communications, and entertainment.
